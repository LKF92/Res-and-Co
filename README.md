Final project of LeRÃ©acteur bootcamp of 2 weeks in a group of 5 persons, during which we developed a MVP (version 1) for the startup Res&Co that fight food waste in restaurants. They are currently deploying the v1 to test the market in Paris and hopefully raise investments.

In the project, I participated in the development of :

- the booking system (Mongoose, Moment.js)

- the filter to search for restaurants with offers available at specific dates, zipcode, price range and/or number of seats available

- the map to show restaurants available around you

- the back office to manage easily the database (a basic CRUD of restaurants and bookings)
